      We, the winners of the CryptoBrawl 2021 competition, team <em>BankBusters</em>, 
      have been waiting over <em id="days-since">###</em> days since the announcement of the results!.
      It also means that the polish <em>Ministry of Finance</em> was able to deliver our awards from
      another competition around <em id="times-since">###</em> times faster!.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will need diplomas from the competition in order to apply for scholarships, and we didn't think that
      the 2022 deadline would prove such a difficulty for an 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_World_War_II">
        international corporation, 
      </a>
      as big as IBM. It turns out we underestimated their incompetence.
    </p>
    <p>
    Organizers have said that we will receive our prizes <em>by Christmas</em>, but here we are, hearing that
      we will have to wait more. Even the announcement of the results took far more time then it needed to 
      (does anyone at IBM know how to pick the first result from the list, in less time then a week?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication from the organizers has been terrible, (not to mention the initial quality of the contest platform
      and its up-time wasn't perfect), they take multiple days in order to reply to basic queries, if they reply at all.
